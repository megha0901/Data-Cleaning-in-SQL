# Data-Cleaning-in-SQL
This SQL Server project was primarily focused on data quality and integrity. It involved a comprehensive data cleaning process that assessed the existing data, identified and addressed inconsistencies, standardized data, and enriched it. The project also included data validation, documentation, and data quality assurance processes to maintain high data standards. The result was a cleansed and well-documented database, providing stakeholders with reliable data for decision-making, reporting, and strategic planning, while also serving as a solid foundation for future data-driven initiatives and database development.
